    carries little of the stress that minimum is sized for.

    ``A_s_min`` is the minimum as the clause writes it. ``A_s_min_eff`` is the

    ``VRd`` under EN 1992-1-1 -- as the governing combination saw it, so it is
    the resistance ``DCR`` was formed from. Under ACI it can differ between
    combinations: ``V_c`` moves with the axial load and with which face is in
    tension. The per-combination results carry each one's own.

    ``options`` are the stirrup layouts the last design found: ``options[0]``
    is the one applied, and the rest are one layout per other bar diameter
    the code offers, lighter and heavier alike, in order of diameter -- each
    the widest spacing with the fewest legs that covers the demand read at
    the depth that bar gives the section. Only the ones the finished section
    passes with are kept, shear and flexure, so a drawing can take any of
    them for the bar at hand; each carries its ``section_DCR``, the worst of
    the section built with it, flexure included -- not always this result's
    ``DCR``, which is the shear's. Empty when the stirrups were not
    designed, or were changed by hand afterwards.
