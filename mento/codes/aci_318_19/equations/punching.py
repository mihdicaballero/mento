"""Two-way (punching) shear equations of ACI 318-19 and CIRSOC 201-25.

CIRSOC 201-25 reprints Chapter 22.6 and §8.4 under the same numbering, and the
two codes share the punching checker. One thing they print differently reaches
this module, and only one: the (b) and (c) expressions of Table 22.6.5.2, noted
in :func:`concrete_shear_stress`. When that table is implemented its
coefficients have to arrive as data from the code's registry entry, the way
``stirrup_spacing_caps`` already does — never from a comparison against a
design-code string, which ``tests/test_architecture_boundaries.py`` forbids.

**Not implemented yet.** This module is the shape of Phase 2, not its content:
every function below is the signature its clause asks for, with the units each
argument is expected in, and a body that raises. The formulas are being
recreated from a validated Calcpad sheet and land one at a time, each with the
worked example that checks it.

Per ADR-0005 these are free functions over plain floats. Two unit systems, one
per set of published coefficients:

- metric — N, mm, MPa (= N/mm²), N·mm
- imperial — lb, in, psi, lb·in

ACI publishes separately rounded coefficients for the two (``0.33√f'c`` in MPa
against ``4√f'c`` in psi), so a function whose coefficients differ takes an
``imperial: bool`` and works in either. The unit *system* is a parameter; the
units within it are fixed and stated per argument.

Geometry — where the critical section runs, how long it is, and where its
centroid sits once an opening or a free edge has clipped it — is not here. It
belongs to the element, which hands this module a length and a section modulus
already computed; see :mod:`mento.punching`.

    ``0.33*λ_s*λ*sqrt(f_c)`` (``4*λ_s*λ*sqrt(f_c)`` in psi) in both codes.

    CIRSOC 201-25 Tabla 22.6.5.2 differs in how it prints (b) and (c). It keeps
    the factored form of the in-lb edition, ``0.17*(1 + 2/β)*λ_s*λ*sqrt(f_c)``
    and ``0.083*(2 + α_s*d/b_0)*λ_s*λ*sqrt(f_c)``, where ACI 318-19 SI rounds
    the two terms separately into ``(0.17 + 0.33/β)*λ_s*λ*sqrt(f_c)`` and
    ``(0.17 + 0.083*α_s*d/b_0)*λ_s*λ*sqrt(f_c)``. (The ACI in-lb edition prints
    ``(2 + 4/β)`` and ``(2 + α_s*d/b_0)``, which is what CIRSOC converted.) The
    gap is small — 0.34/β against 0.33/β, and 0.166 against 0.17 — but it is
    real, so these coefficients are the per-code datum this module needs from
    the registry.

    The datum has to be scoped to Table 22.6.5.2 alone, not to some general "new
    form or old form" flag, because ACI 318-19 SI is not consistent with itself:
    its own Table 22.6.6.1 prints the factored ``0.17*(1 + 2/β)`` and
    ``0.083*(2 + α_s*d/b_0)``, exactly as CIRSOC 201-25 does in both tables. So
    Table 22.6.6.1 is identical in the two codes and needs no datum at all.

    Not applied by the signature: §22.6.3.1 of both codes limits sqrt(f_c) to
    8.3 MPa (100 psi) for two-way v_c, so the implementation takes
    ``min(sqrt(f_c), 8.3)`` — in this table and in Table 22.6.6.1 alike.

    Args:
        f_c: concrete compressive strength [MPa | psi].
        beta: ratio of the long to the short side of the column, dimensionless.
        alpha_s: the location factor of :func:`location_factor`.

    CIRSOC 201-25 C 8.4.4.2.3 differs, and wrongly: it prints a minus sign in
