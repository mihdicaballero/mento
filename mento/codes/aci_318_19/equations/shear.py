"""One-way shear equations — ACI 318-19, Chapter 22.5 and Table 9.6.3.4.

CIRSOC 201-25 reprints the same chapter under the same numbering, so every
function below carries both citations. Only two things the two codes print
differently reach this module, and each is noted where it arises: the
coefficient of §9.6.3.1 (CIRSOC 0.085 against ACI 0.083) and the absolute caps
of Table 9.7.6.2.2, which arrive as arguments from the code's registry entry.
The §22.5.3.1 ceiling on sqrt(f'c) is *not* one of them — 8.3 MPa in both books
— so :func:`sqrt_f_c_for_shear` holds it as a constant rather than as a hook.

Pure functions of floats; see the package docstring for the unit convention and
for why the SI and US customary coefficients are both spelled out instead of
one being converted into the other.
