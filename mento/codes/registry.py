"""What a design code has to provide, and which ones provide it.

Every element used to dispatch by comparing ``concrete.design_code`` against a
string literal -- in :mod:`mento.beam`, :mod:`mento.shear_wall`,
:mod:`mento.rebar` and the summaries -- so adding a code meant finding and
editing each of those chains, and forgetting one failed silently at runtime
rather than at import.

A code declares itself here instead. :class:`DesignCode` is the whole contract:
if a new code fills one in and registers it, every element picks it up, and
``tests/test_architecture_boundaries.py`` fails the build if an element ever
grows a string comparison again.

The hooks are plain functions rather than methods on a class, matching how
``codes/`` is already written (ADR-0002): the code modules hold free functions
typed as ``self: RectangularBeam``, and a registry of them adds no indirection
that has to be stepped through when reading a check.
