"""A section's geometry and materials as plain floats, converted once.

ADR-0005 puts pint at the boundary and floats in the equations, and Phase 1 did
that for the equations themselves. It left the *state* in pint, so every helper
unwrapped its inputs and re-wrapped its output, and the boundary was crossed at
every step rather than once.

Measured on an ACI shear check, that was 19 unit-changing conversions costing
~1.17 ms of the check's 1.43 ms. A conversion that actually changes units costs
~58 us; one that does not costs ~3.9 us. Nothing here is about how the unit is
spelled -- ``.to("cm")`` and ``.to(cm)`` measure the same -- it is about not
converting at all.

So a section publishes its values once, in the unit system its design code
writes its coefficients for, and the check runs entirely in floats. The result
is wrapped back into pint where it leaves the check.
