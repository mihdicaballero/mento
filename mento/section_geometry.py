"""Where the bars and the stirrup legs of a section are, as data.

The shear and flexure checks never place a bar or a leg: they reason with a
clear distance between bars, an effective depth, and a spacing of the legs
across the width. This module turns that model into positions, so that a
drawing -- mento's own ``beam.plot()`` or any other -- can show the section the
check assumed without deriving anything again::

    geometry = beam.section_geometry
    geometry.leg_x            # centrelines of the stirrup legs, left to right
    geometry.stirrups         # the closed stirrups, perimeter first
    geometry.bars_on("bottom", layer=1)

Each position is the check's own model, and a test ties each one to it:

- **Legs**: ``n_legs = 2·n_stirrups`` legs spread evenly between the centres
  of the outermost pair, ``x_i = c_c + d_st/2 + i·s_w`` with
  ``s_w = (b - 2·c_c - d_st)/(n_legs - 1)`` -- the ``s_w`` the check holds to
  Table 9.7.6.2.2 (Expression (9.8N) under EN 1992-1-1).
- **Cage**: one perimeter closed stirrup on the outermost legs and inner
  closed stirrups on legs (2, 3), (4, 5)...; an odd leg left over is a
  crosstie (see :func:`mento.design_results.cage_legs`).
- **Bars**: each layer spread evenly between the inner faces of the outer
  legs, one clear distance apart -- the clear spacing the check reads
  (``_layer_clear_spacing``) -- with the first bar's face at ``c_c + d_st``
  and the last at ``b - c_c - d_st``; a layer of one bar at mid-width. The
  groups of a layer (``n1``/``n2``, ``n3``/``n4``) alternate symmetrically:
  the ``n1`` bars at the ends, the ``n2`` bars in between. Layer 1 sits at
  ``c_c + d_st + d/2`` from its face, layer 2 at
  ``c_c + d_st + max(d_b1, d_b2) + layers_spacing + d/2``, the offsets the
  effective depth is computed with.

The legs are not tied to the bars: the check does not do that either, so an
inner leg may sit where no bar is. That is the model, shown honestly.

A slab strip (``OneWaySlab``, ``Footing``) is detailed by spacings, not by a
count of bars in a cage: its bars per strip are ``width / s`` and need not be
whole, and it has no cage. Its geometry publishes the section, the cover, the
stirrup diameter and ``s_w``, with no bars and no legs, rather than positions
that would contradict its own ``Ø10/14`` label.

Calculation layer: no drawing library is imported here. The section is read
once through its float view (ADR-0005) and the lengths are wrapped into pint
on the way out, in the display unit of the section (cm, or in).
