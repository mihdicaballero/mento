"""Properties every flexure design has to have, swept over sections and moments.

The examples elsewhere pin numbers; these pin behaviour across a grid wide enough
to reach the cases a single example misses -- a section past the tension-controlled
limit, a catalogue with no bars between A_s,req and A_s,max, compression steel that
only works in one layer. Each property was broken before it was written down:

* A design passes its own check. If it found a layout, that layout carries the
  moment and keeps within the code's limits; if it did not, it says so. In a sweep
  of 960 ACI 318-19 designs (b 12-25 cm, h 25-60 cm, f'c 20-30 MPa, up to twice
  the singly reinforced limit) the code before this left 311 with DCR > 1 and no
  warning, and 195 that were not tension-controlled, also without one.
* The capacity a check reports is never more than the section has. It is compared
  here with strain compatibility written out again, independently of mento: the
  check used to cut the tension steel back to A_s,max + A_s'*f_s'/f_y and keep
  phi = 0.90, which in the same sweep passed 32 designs whose real DCR was up to
  1.07.
* The steel asked for never drops as the moment grows. It fell back to A_s,max once
  the moment passed what tension steel alone can carry.

    A_s,max read off the section -- a value no round of the flexure design
    writes there: the reporting check of the round before had left it,
