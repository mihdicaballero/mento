"""Properties every flexure design has to have, swept over sections and moments.

The examples elsewhere pin numbers; these pin behaviour across a grid wide enough
to reach the cases a single example misses -- a section past the tension-controlled
limit, a catalogue with no bars between A_s,req and A_s,max, compression steel that
only works in one layer. Each property was broken before it was written down:

* A design passes its own check. If it found a layout, that layout carries the
  moment and keeps within the code's limits; if it did not, it says so. In a sweep
  of 960 ACI 318-19 designs (b 12-25 cm, h 25-60 cm, f'c 20-30 MPa, up to twice
  the singly reinforced limit) the code before this left 311 with DCR > 1 and no
  warning, and 195 that were not tension-controlled, also without one.
* The capacity a check reports is never more than the section has. It is compared
  here with strain compatibility written out again, independently of mento: the
  check used to cut the tension steel back to A_s,max + A_s'*f_s'/f_y and keep
  phi = 0.90, which in the same sweep passed 32 designs whose real DCR was up to
  1.07.
* The steel asked for never drops as the moment grows. It fell back to A_s,max once
  the moment passed what tension steel alone can carry.

    """ACI 20x25, f'c 30, c_c 40 mm, Mu = +45.19 kN·m: the top only ever carries compression.

    With no negative moment the top is asked for the compression the bottom
    needs, and nothing caps that. The design capped it anyway with the top's
    A_s,max read off the section -- a value no round of the flexure design
    writes there: the reporting check of the round before had left it,
    7.05 cm². So the round redone with the final Ø10 stirrup searched the top
    under a cap the first round never had, and the design ended on 2Ø12 +
    1Ø12 in two layers under 2Ø25, DCR 1.206. Searched with no cap, as the
    first round was, it ends on 2Ø25 below and 2Ø32 above, DCR 0.879, the
    layout PR #164 designed. Neither is tension-controlled: the section is
    too shallow for the moment, and ``As_above_max`` says so either way. A
    design redone after a check ends where the first one did.
