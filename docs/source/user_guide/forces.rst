Forces
============

The `Forces` class in the `mento` package allows users to define and manipulate the primary forces acting on a structural element, such as axial force,
shear force, and bending moment. This class is designed for flexibility in defining forces, with the ability to adjust and retrieve
them in different stages of a structural analysis or design workflow.

Key Concepts
------------

- **Axial Force (`N_x`)**: Force applied along the axis of the element, along the x-x axis.
- **Shear Force (`V_z`)**: Force acting perpendicular to the axis of the element, along the z-z local axis.
- **Bending Moment (`M_y`)**: The moment caused by forces that induce bending about the y-y axis.
- **Unit System**: You can define the unit system to display the forces for a Force object, *metric* or *imperial*.

These are the main forces considered to  analyze a beam along it's main axis.
For Columns analysis in future releases, the Forces object will have to have shear and bending moment in both axis.

These forces are defined using compatible units from the `Pint` library, like `kN` or `kip` for forces and `kN*m` or `ft*kip` for moments.

Usage
-----

Below is a step-by-step guide on how to use the `Forces` class in your structural analysis workflows.

1. Creating a Forces Object
**********

To define the forces acting on a structural element, instantiate a `Forces` object. You can provide initial values for axial force (`N_x`), shear force (`V_z`), and bending moment (`M_y`). If no values are provided, the forces default to zero.
The default unit_system for units display is *metric*.

.. code-block:: python

    from mento import Forces, kN, kNm

    # Define a forces object with specific values
    force = Forces(N_x=2*kN, V_z=10*kN, M_y=5*kNm)
    print(force)

2. Accessing Forces
**********

Once a `Forces` object is created, you can access individual forces using the respective properties `N_x`, `V_z`, and `M_y`. These properties will return the forces in metric system by default, making it easy to inspect the current state of forces in your structure.

.. code-block:: python

    print(force.N_x)  # Output: 2.00 kN
    print(force.V_z)  # Output: 10.00 kN
    print(force.M_y)  # Output: 5.00 kN*m

If you want to display the Forces in *imperial system* just pass the input to the Force object when creating it.

.. code-block:: python

    force = Forces(N_x=2*kN, V_z=10*kN, M_y=5*kNm, unit_system="imperial")
    print(force.N_x)  # Output: 0.45 kip
    print(force.V_z)  # Output: 2.25 kip
    print(force.M_y)  # Output: 3.69 ft*kip

3. Modifying Forces
**********

Forces can be modified at any point by calling the `set_forces()` method. This method allows you to update the values of `N_x`, `V_z`, and `M_y`.

.. code-block:: python

    # Update the axial and moment forces
    force.set_forces(N_x=3*kN, M_y=7*kNm)
    force.unit_system = "metric"
    print(force)

4. Retrieving Forces as a Dictionary
**********

You can retrieve the forces in the form of a dictionary for easy manipulation, storage, or reporting. The `get_forces()` method returns a dictionary where the keys are `N_x`, `V_z`, and `M_y`, with values corresponding to the respective forces in the unit system.

.. code-block:: python

    force_dict = force.get_forces()
    print(force_dict)
    # Output: {'N_x': 3.00 kN, 'V_z': 10.00 kN, 'M_y': 7.00 kN*m}

5. Assigning a Label to a Force
**********

Optionally, you can assign a label to a force object to describe the specific load condition or scenario (e.g., "Crane load", "Wind load"). This is useful in complex models where multiple forces are acting on different elements.

.. code-block:: python

    force.label = "Crane load"
    print(force.label)  # Output: Crane load

6. Force Object ID
**********

Each `Forces` object is automatically assigned a unique ID, which can be accessed through the `id` property. This is helpful when tracking multiple force objects in more complex analyses.

.. code-block:: python

    print(force.id)  # Output: Unique ID (e.g., 1, 2, etc.)

7. Print Force complete properties
**********

Each `Forces` object con be printed in the terminal with `print(force)` method. This allows to quickly assess a Forces object.

.. code-block:: python

    print(force)  # Output: Force ID: 1, Label: Crane load, N_x: 3.00 kN, V_z: 0.00 kN, M_y: 7.00 kNÂ·m

This flexible interface ensures that you can easily manage forces during the design and analysis of structural elements, while maintaining clear and consistent units.
